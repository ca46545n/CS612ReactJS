Hello, I created a Gamer Review Blog for girls  were i reviewed 3 of my favourite games from each 3 categorys.
I have used HTML and CSS for Structure and styling of the webpage.
I have used ReactJS for a single page website and used Redux of data flow, which allows the webpage to get data without refreshing the dom.

Steps:
1) Open Terminal and change directory to the project folder.
2) execute "npm start" command on terminal.
3) open http://localhost:8080/ on the browser.
